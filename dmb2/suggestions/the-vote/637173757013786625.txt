However, I don\u2019t know if some DMs willingness to make a session for one or more players is widely known (which is good, the poor DM would probably be awash with requests). \n\nI was thinking that a text-tab, where members of the server could post ideas they had for such a session, could be a good addition for the server. Posting an idea in the tab would not mean the session the member proposed will happen, but it might be a neat opportunity for some more DM/player coordinated sessions, help a DM in an Idea drought, or simply be a cool chance for a player to think about and develop their character, even if the idea never is played out.", "author_id": 273930880098238465, "\u270b": 0}

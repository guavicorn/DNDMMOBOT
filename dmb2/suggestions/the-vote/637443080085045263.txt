This means as a fighter with spellcasting can cast two, 1 action leveled spells with action surge and a leveled reaction spell(shield) on the same turn.  Howerver as soon as you cast a bonus action spell (e.g shillelagh) that same fighter could only cast one additional cantrip.  A druid could not cast goodberry and shillelagh or shillelagh and on the same turn.  However the use of bonus actions from other classes (rogue cunning action, etc) does not impose the same limitation.  \nI propose a more leniant rulling:\n\n When a spell is cast with the casting time of 1 bonus action, either the bonus action spell or any spells with a casting time of 1 action must be cantrips until the end of turn."}

Name, Race, Class, Stats, Location etc.  These would be shop owners, MWers, people of importance.  For instance, a player knew of a Masterworker NPC he used previously wanted to use again but I didn't have any of the information to complete the MW session.  I understand some people maybe protective of their NPCs but having a central area to keep track of free use NPCs would be nice.  I keep track of my NPCs and try to post the relevent info in the summary so others can recreate the interaction with the stats and rolls in bot channel.  The woobly website did have a couple NPC MWers but it hasn't been updated in a bit.", "\ud83d\udc4e": 0, "author_id": 545415922459082792}
